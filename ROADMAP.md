I didn't get to finish within the time allowed, but I managed to get a the main, although unstyled, structure of what I wanted. 

I decided to focus my time on: 
  - breaking down the basic structure of what I though the app should look like
  - getting the menu from the api(this caused the most issue for me and took a more time than usual since I was getting cors errors that weren't showing up)
  - and functionality/ quality of code for anyone who may go in and work on it. 


If I had more time, I would have loved to finish:
  - setting up the order component with the remove from order option
  - adding tests to make sure adding and removing items works as expected
  - polish the app up do not have scrolling of the order page if menu has to scroll. 
  - adding the structure for submitting an order
